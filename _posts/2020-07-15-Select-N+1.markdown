The one thing you should not event remotely think about doing is that writing code with Select N+1 problem. You can easily identify the problem just looking at the code. How hard it going to be?

Anyway, the code I am refactoring contains bunch of blocks with Select N+1 problem.

{% highlight csharp %}
foreach (var model in models)
{
    // Some logic

    // Warning: Select N+1
    IEnumerable<Foo> foos = _fooRepository.GetById(model.fooId);
    foreach (var foo in foos)
    {
        // Some logic
    }
    _fooRepository.Update(foos);
}  
{% endhighlight %}

What a way to spend my time today? ðŸ˜·
